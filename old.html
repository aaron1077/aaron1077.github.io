        <h2>Box Mods</h2>
        <p  id="box">
            Box mods are great because they generate a lot of vape and a strong hit.<br>
            Most box mods also come with a screen to adjust the wattage.<br>
            Although, some box mods are big and uncomfortable to carry.<br>
        </p><br>
        <h2>Cylinder Mods</h2>
        <p  id="cylinder">
            Cylinder mods are my favorite because they can give just as much wattage and hit power that<br>
            a box mod does, but they fit easier in your hand are easier to carry because of their shape.<br>
            They also have a display screen to adjust wattage so they are easily my favorite in my opinion.<br>
        </p><br>
        <h2>Mechanical Mods</h2>
        <p id="mechanical">
            Mechanical mods are mods that you build yourself. Your able to build the mod to your perfect liking.<br>
            The problem with mechanical mods is if you don't know what you are doing <br>
            you can cause a lot of issues to your device. Some peoples mechanical mods explode because they built it wrong.<br>
            I advice you not to build one unless you have a good understanding of how to do it correctly.<br>
