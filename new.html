            <h2>Box mod</h2>
            <p>
                Box mods are great because they generate a lot of vape and a strong hit.<br>
                Most box mods also come with a screen to adjust the wattage.<br>
                Although, some box mods are big and uncomfortable to carry.

            <h2>Cylinder mod</h2>
            <p>
                Cylinder mods are my favorite because they can give just as much wattage and hit power that<br>
                a box mod does, but they fit easier in your hand are easier to carry because of their shape.<br>
                They also have a display screen to adjust wattage so they are easily my favorite in my opinion.

            <h2>Mechanical mod</h2>
            <p>
                Mechanical mods are mods that you build yourself. Your able to build the mod to your perfect liking.<br>
                The problem with mechanical mods is if you don't know what you are doing <br>
                you can cause a lot of issues to your device. Some peoples mechanical mods explode because they built it wrong.<br>
                I advice you not to build one unless you have a good understanding of how to do it correctly.
